The default codespace configuration has R and Rstudio set up for it (so probably use that one)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can run Rstudio within a Codespace by:\n\nGo into the VS Code section called ‚ÄúPorts‚Äù in the Codespace\nFind the Rstudio port\nClick the Open in Browser button\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nTroubleshooting\n\nIf you make a new Codespace you may need to install the R packages onto the machine again\nThe easiest way is to open the Rstudio port (see point 2 above)\nIn the Rstudio console execute renv::restore() and follow its instructions. It should download all the packages in the renv folder in this repo\n\n\nNow you can run this code in a browser window without needing to install any software on your computer üòé",
